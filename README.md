# EasyDocs

**EasyDocs** is a lightweight Avalonia UI desktop application that can generate structured **PDF/HTML** documentation from **XML comments** in C# source files. Designed to save developers time, it transforms existing code comments into clean, professional documents with minimal effort.

## Why I Built This
Writing technical documentation can be repetitive, especially when the code is already self-documented.  
This tool bridges the gap by turning XML comments into formal documentation, streamlining workflows and reducing busywork.

## Features
- **Flexible Input** – Select individual files or scan entire directories (and subdirectories).  
- **Automated Parsing** – Reads XML comments directly from C# source code.
- **Documentation Output** – Generates organized, ready-to-use style PDF documents, or HTML pages.  


## Future Plans
I am planning to add support for multiple programming languages including C++, Vb.NET and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C# / .NET**
- **Avalonia UI**
- **Roslyn Library** for parsing C# source files
- **MigraDoc & PDF Sharp** for generating PDF files.
- **MessageBox.Avalonia** for quick and simple warning messages.
